Part One: Solidify Terminology
In your own terms, define the following terms:

What is HTTP? how browsers and servers communicate

What is a URL? universal resource locators

What is DNS? domain name system that turns a website to an IP address

What is a query string? values assigned to parameters

What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? GET: receives requested information. POST: alters requested information

What is an HTTP request? message sent to the server

What is an HTTP response? the message sent back from the server

What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen. additional info passed with a HTTP request.request: language you want, date that browser thinks it is, hostname asking about. response: content type, cookies that the server wants to set, caching info

What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser? the site is turned into an IP address, browser makes request to that IP address, server sends a response, browser creates the html and creates requests for any other resources needed for the page
